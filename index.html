    <section id="about">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an environmental engineer, educator, and social innovator focused on solving societal-scale challenges at the intersection of engineering, public health, and planetary health. I am widely recognized for Environmental Engineering 3.0, a vision that reframes the profession to prioritize societal impact, ethical responsibility, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
        <br>Through the V-shaped professional model and the Nurse+Engineer framework, I develop engineers who can bridge disciplines, translate knowledge across domains, and deliver measurable impact. By partnering with nurses, public health professionals, and communities, I demonstrate how interprofessional collaboration strengthens resilience and drives systemic solutions.
        <br>I lead initiatives such as COAST (Caribbean Ocean and Aquaculture Sustainability Facility), which integrates environmental modeling, community engagement, and parametric insurance to protect livelihoods and improve food security for over 200,000 fisherfolk and families in the Caribbean. Through GRoWES, my teams have improved clean water and nutrition for more than 300,000 children and villagers across Guatemala, Brazil, Ghana, India, Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania.
        <br>My research identifies structural barriers in engineering — the care penalty — which undervalues work that benefits communities and the environment. I address these challenges through mastery learning, curriculum innovation, and professional formation strategies to prepare engineers capable of systemic problem-solving.
        <br>As Executive Director of AAEES and President of CESB, I advocate for board certification, accreditation, and policy reforms that elevate standards for professional excellence and leadership. My work has been recognized across engineering, nursing, and public health communities, including Champion of Nursing (ANA, 2024), 13 fellowships (FAAN, FAEESP, FNAP), and 3 Fulbright awards (India, Brazil, England).
        <br>I welcome collaborations with those interested in interdisciplinary solutions to complex global challenges, leveraging engineering, health, and policy to create measurable impact for people and the planet.
